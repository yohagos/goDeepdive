// Go supports pointers, allowing you to pass references to values 
// and records within your program.

// Weâ€™ll show how pointers work in contrast to values with 
// 2 functions: zeroval and zeroptr. zeroval has an int parameter, 
// so arguments will be passed to it by value. zeroval will get a copy 
// of ival distinct from the one in the calling function.
func zeroval(ival int) {
	ival = 0
}

// zeroptr in contrast has an *int parameter, meaning that it takes 
// an int pointer. The *iptr code in the function body then 
// dereferences the pointer from its memory address to the current 
// value at that address. Assigning a value to a dereferenced 
// pointer changes the value at the referenced address.
func zeroptr(iptr *int) {
	*iptr = 0
}

func Pointers() {
	i := 1
	println("initial => ", i)

	zeroval(i)
	println("zeroval => ", i)
	// The &i syntax gives the memory address of i, i.e. a pointer to i.
	zeroptr(&i)
	println("zeroptr => ", i)

	// Pointers can be printed too.
	println("pointer => ", &i)
}
