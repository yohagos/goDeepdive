// embed is a compiler directive that allows programs to include arbitrary files and folders in the  binary at build time. Read more about the embed directive here.

//Import the embed package; if you donâ€™t use any exported identifiers from this package, you can do a blank import with _ "embed".

import (
	"embed"
)

//embed directives accept paths relative to the directory containing the Go source file. This directive embeds the contents of the file into the string variable immediately following it.

// embed folder/single_file.txt
var fileString string

//Or embed the contents of the file into a []byte.

// embed folder/single_file.txt
var fileByte []byte

//We can also embed multiple files or even folders with wildcards. This uses a variable of the embed.FS type, which implements a simple virtual file system.

// embed folder/single_file.txt
// embed folder/*.hash
var folder embed.FS

func EmbedDirectives() {

	//Print out the contents of single_file.txt.

	print(fileString)
	print(string(fileByte))

	//Retrieve some files from the embedded folder.

	content1, _ := folder.ReadFile("folder/file1.hash")
	print(string(content1))

	content2, _ := folder.ReadFile("folder/file2.hash")
	print(string(content2))
}
